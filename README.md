#  LMU DuckDB to MoTec converter

This Python script is designed to preprocess and format raw telemetry data files stored in **DuckDB format** (often generated by simulators like Assetto Corsa Competizione via [Logic Monitor Utility logs]) into a **clean, interpolated CSV file**.

The resulting CSV is optimized for direct use with [**MotecLogGenerator**](https://github.com/stevendaniluk/MotecLogGenerator), allowing you to create MoTeC i2 compatible `.ld` or `.ldx` files.

## 🚧 Development Status: Early/Session Telemetry

This is an early iteration of the converter. Currently, it focuses on extracting and preparing **the entire telemetry session log** from the DuckDB file, applying interpolation and unit conversions to the essential channels.

Future development will focus on incorporating more data, refining channel definitions, and potentially adding lap-by-lap data handling.

##  Key Features

* **Time Axis Interpolation:** Normalizes and resamples all telemetry data onto a uniform time axis (0.01 second step) to ensure maximum compatibility and accuracy in MoTeC analysis.
* **Integrated Unit Conversion:** Automatically converts the speed channel from **meters per second ($\text{m/s}$) to kilometers per hour ($\text{km/h}$)** directly within the CSV generation process.
    * *Note: The output channel is explicitly named `Speed_KPH`.*
* **Channel Handling:** Processes and merges essential channels, including **Engine RPM**, **Boost Pressure**, and **Coolant Temp**. The problematic `Gear` channel has been excluded to ensure clean session data export.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the script, you must have **Python** installed on your system and all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Dependency Installation

1.  Ensure you are in the project's root directory.
2.  Install all necessary libraries (primarily `pandas`, `duckdb`, `numpy`, and `tkinter` for the file selection GUI):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
